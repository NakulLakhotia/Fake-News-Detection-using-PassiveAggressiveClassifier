A very good example of this would be to detect fake news on a social media website like Twitter, where new data is being added every second. To dynamically read data from Twitter continuously, the data would be huge, and using an online-learning algorithm would be ideal.

Passive-Aggressive algorithms are somewhat similar to a Perceptron model, in the sense that they do not require a learning rate. However, they do include a regularization parameter.[Reference : GeeksForGeeks]
